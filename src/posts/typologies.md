# Overview typologies

There as many ways to describe social groups that there are field of studies out there. This diversity has led some people to say that it is pointless to hope to build a parsimonious typlogy of groups (Epstein). One reason why is because our grouping of human groups are made up  anyway (Boyer p.56), or the grouping play some roles (Thomassen?)

Anyway, here we provide an overview of the full diversity of social groups out there.

## Anthropology

Anthropologists are interested in the structure and dynamics of kinship groups. Kinships are social groups that comprise sets of genetically related individuals and exhibit a number of kin-based institutions, or social norms. Those institutions cut across all aspects of human lives---regulating marriages, descent, post-marital residence, family organizations and governance---making humans a deeply cultural species.

With kinship groups, there is a clear distinction between in-groups and out-groups, with ethnic markers being easily recognized by related groups. Within groups, there are clear rules about interactions that are intersect with age and sex. 

Kin-based institutions are tremendously complex and far-reaching, and still predominant in the world. In many countries, marrying your cousins is not taboo, elders still play important role in decision-taking, kins are allowed to police your kids' behaviors, and it is alright to promote your network's collective success whenever possible. All of this characterized kin-based psychology, as explored by Henrich (2020, p.37).

As such, one can measure the kinship intensity of a society, with respect to what is known from tradition societies.
