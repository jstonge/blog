The idea of social groups behaving according to their own set of peculiar laws, or group-level behaviors, is controversial. In this brief blog post, I explore the idea that part of the controversy stems from group-level behaviors conflicting with our Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic, or WEIRD, ontology. I know this won't be an easy sell, as I will argue that science is not this disembodied activity, independent from its Western origins. But I do beliefe that to properly assess the validity group-level stance, we need to wrestle with our WEIRD origins. Strap on your anthropological hat, here we go. 

What is meant by WEIRD ontology? A striking example is that of individual responsability. In Western legal systems, we make a strong distinction between crimes that were intentional and premeditated from crimes done in the heat of passion. There are many studies showing that accidents thought to be unintentional are judged less severely by WEIRD than non-WEIRD people. Why? Most other cultures, or ontologies, have other their ways to account for responsability. 

In traditional societies, when accidents happen, people ask themselves <em>why</em> it happened. Why did that pieces of roof fall that exact moment where that person happened to be sitting. When looking for an explanation, they might appeal to witchcraft, meaning that this person who was sitting there might have had enemies.

Not all modern societies are willing to charge individuals before groups, or say, corporations. [cite JAPAN studies showing how they judge groups more than people. Note that the law is more the tip of the iceberg. Causation is really a cluster of norms and expectations].

All of this to say that admiting group-level behavoirs conflict with the cherish ideas that individuals should be held responsible for their actions? If not, chaos would ensue, no question ask. Now, underlying this argument about responsability there is the notion of causation. 

In science, we like stories that are explained by simple mechanisms. Take the cause of scurvy, for example. We were all taught that citrus fruits prevent scurvy, but this understanding was later superseded by the discovery of vitamin C. Once we have that knowledge of this causative agents, we could easily predict the outcome of our actions. Similarly, if you go on wikipedia, it states that the cause for the COVID-19 pandemic is the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We know the causative agents, we can predict the outcome of our actions, right?

Arguably not. The catch is in the idea that the COVID-19 <em>pandemic</em> was caused by SARS-CoV-2. Even when we knew about the transmission mechanism of the disease, we couldn't predict the outcome of our public health actions. Boldly stated, there is not reason to think that the SARS-CoV-2 has epistemic primacy over how different cultures adapted to the pandemic. 

If anything, our inability to act towards climate change is the cause of the pandemic because modern societies are decimating biodiveristy, which acted as a barrier againsts the emergence of zoonotic pathogen in humans. Cultural variations in mask-wearing and social distancing is the cause of the pandemic. Some groups delayed strong public health measures, until infection rates surged,  causing the virus to spread to countries that were doing alright.

Returning to our claim, does our WEIRD ontology, rooted in individualistic thinking, is what make the idea of group-level behaviors uncomfortable? I hope by this point the answer is, maybe. Does it make the group stuff true? Definitely not, this is not how it works.
