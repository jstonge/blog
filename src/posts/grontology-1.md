A physicist and philosopher walk into a bar. The physicist asks to the philosopher, what do you think are irreducible social groups? 

The philosopher answers that groups are irreducible when they exhibit collective intentionality. For instance, he says, consider when a group of people walks together to go dinner, and that someone decide to stray away without saying anything. The group as a whole might be annoyed because of the expected joint commitment that they were going to dinner. The physcisist nodes, but then ask how is she modeling this so-called 'collective intentionality'. "With clearly defined arguments that follow the laws of logic", the philosopher says, "how would you?". 

Well, say hesitantly the physcisits, assume a large population of people. We define M groups of equal size. Assume that each individuals in a group can adopt one of two behaviors, say cooperative or not. The cooperative behaviors is defined by individuals paying a cost when adopting the cooperative behavior, but there is a group benefits such that everybody would be better-off adopting the behaviors. Furthermore, assume that 'groups' can take action to encourage cooperative behaviors. We say that groups are irreducible to individuals when the probability of adopting cooperative behaviors is a function of the group as a whole taking actions, not individuals....
